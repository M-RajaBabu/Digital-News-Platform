# Digital News Platform ER Diagram (Mermaid)

## How to Render and Export This Diagram as an Image

1. **Copy the Mermaid code block below (everything between and including the ```mermaid and ``` lines).**
2. **Go to [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live).**
3. **Paste the code into the editor on the left.**
4. **If you see an error, make sure you are copying the code block exactly as shown, including the 'erDiagram' keyword and all indentation.**
5. **The diagram will render on the right. Click the 'Download' or 'Export' button to save as PNG or SVG.**

### Troubleshooting
- If you see a syntax error, ensure there are no extra spaces or missing lines in the code block.
- The code block must start with ```mermaid and end with ``` (on their own lines).
- If you still have issues, try pasting only the lines starting from 'erDiagram' (without the triple backticks) into the Mermaid Live Editor.
